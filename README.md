# DATA MODELING WITH POSTGRES

**Introduction:**
A startup called Sparkify wants to analyze the data they've been collecting on songs and user activity on their new music streaming app. The analytics team is particularly interested in understanding what songs users are listening to. Currently, they don't have an easy way to query their data, which resides in a directory of JSON logs on user activity on the app, as well as a directory with JSON metadata on the songs in their app.

They'd like a data engineer to create a Postgres database with tables designed to optimize queries on song play analysis, and bring you on the project. Your role is to create a database schema and ETL pipeline for this analysis. You'll be able to test your database and ETL pipeline by running queries given to you by the analytics team from Sparkify and compare your results with their expected results.

**Project Description:**

In this Project we are applying the skills what we learnt in Data Modeling with Postgres and building an ETL pipeline using Python. We will also define one Fact Table and Four Dimension Tables for a Star schema and write ETL pipeline that transfers data from files into two local directories into these tables in Postgres using SQL.

**Instruction on running Scripts:**

Using Terminal:
    1. python create_tables.py
    2. python etl.py

**DATASETS USED:**

**Song Dataset**
This dataset is a subset of real data from the Million Song Dataset. Each file is in JSON format and contains metadata about a song and the artist of that song. The files are partitioned by the first three letters of each song's track ID. For example, here are filepaths to two files in this dataset.

song_data/A/B/C/TRABCEI128F424C983.json
song_data/A/A/B/TRAABJL12903CDCF1A.json

**Log Dataset**
The second dataset consists of log files in JSON format generated by this event simulator based on the songs in the dataset above. These simulate activity logs from a music streaming app based on specified configurations.

The log files in the dataset you'll be working with are partitioned by year and month. For example, here are filepaths to two files in this dataset.

log_data/2018/11/2018-11-12-events.json
log_data/2018/11/2018-11-13-events.json


**DATABASE SCHEMA:**

In this Project we have used STAR schema by creating one main FACT table (songplays) and four Dimension tables (users, songs, artists, time).

**FACT TABLES:**

1.	songplays

    1. songplay_id	int
    2. start_time	time
    3. user_id		int
    4. level		varchar
    5. song_id		varchar
    6. artist_id	varchar
    7. session_id	int
    8. location	varchar
    9. user_agent	varchar

**DIMENSION TABLES:**

1.	users

    1. user_id		int
    2. first_name	varchar
    3. last_name	varchar
    4. gender		varchar
    5. level		varchar

2.	songs

    1. song_id		varchar
    2. title		varchar
    3. artist_id	varchar
    4. year		int
    5. duration	float

3.	artists

    1. artist_id	varchar
    2. name		varchar
    3. location	varchar
    4. latitude		float
    5. longitude	float

4.	time

    1. start_time	time
    2. hour		int
    3. day		int
    4. week		int
    5. month		int
    6. year		int
    7. weekday	varchar

**Conclusion:**
All steps were executed and project rubric mentioned were achieved to produce the required analysis for this project.
